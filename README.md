# NumberCrunch

This project is a **basic calculator** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides functionalities like basic arithmetic operations, square calculation, percentages, and more.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.
- **Advanced Operations**: Square (`x²`), percentage calculation, reciprocal (`1/x`), and toggle between positive/negative (`±`).
- **Clear Options**: Clear all (C) or the last input (CE).
- **Backspace**: Remove the last entered digit.
- Fully responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Styling the calculator for a clean, user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for calculations and interactions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-project.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calculator-project
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to run the calculator.

## Usage

1. Press numeric buttons and operators for basic arithmetic.
2. Use the advanced features like:
   - Press `x²` to square a number.
   - Press `%` for percentage calculation.
   - Press `1/x` for reciprocal.
   - Use `C` to clear all or `CE` to clear the last input.
3. Press `=` to evaluate expressions.

## Code Structure

- **HTML**: Contains the structure of the calculator interface, with buttons for each function.
- **CSS**: Manages the layout, spacing, and styling of the calculator.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for button clicks, calculations, and edge-case handling.

### JavaScript Highlights

- **Event Listeners**: Handles button clicks for different operations.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Updates the display in real-time as you type.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents divide-by-zero errors and other invalid operations.

## Future Enhancements

- Add scientific functions like trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan).
- Support for multi-step calculations with parentheses.
- Implement a history feature to view past calculations.
